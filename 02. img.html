    The alt attribute holds a text description of the image, which isn't mandatory but is incredibly useful for accessibility  -->

<!-- The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. 
    Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.

    CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests. -->
